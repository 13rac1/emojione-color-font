# Emoji One Color SVGinOT Font
A color and B&W emoji SVGinOT font built primarily from [Emoji One][1] artwork
with support for [ZWJ][2], [skin tone modifiers][3] and [country flags][4].

The font works in all operating systems, but will *currently* only show color
emoji in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. This is not a limitation of the font,
but of the operating systems and applications. Regular B&W outline emoji are
included for backwards/fallback compatibility.

## What is SVGinOT?
*SVG in Open Type* is a standard by Adobe and Mozilla for color OpenType
and Open Font Format fonts. It allows font creators to embed complete SVG files
within a font enabling full color and even animations. There are more details
in the [SVGinOT proposal][6] and the [OpenType SVG table specifications][7].

## Install on Linux
The font can be installed for a user or system-wide. Get the latest version
from releases: https://github.com/eosrei/emojione-color-font/releases

Install for the current user only without root:
```sh
# 1. Download the latest version
wget https://github.com/eosrei/emojione-color-font/releases/download/v1.0-beta3/EmojiOneColor-SVGinOT-Linux-1.0-beta3.zip
# 2. Uncompress the zip file
unzip -o EmojiOneColor-SVGinOT-Linux-1.0-beta3.zip
# 3. Run the installer
./install.sh
```

*Warning: This requires `Bitstream Vera` is installed and will change your
systems default serif, sans-serif and monospace fonts.*

### Why Bitstream Vera
The default serif, sans-serif and monospace font for most Linux distributions is
`DejaVu`. `DejaVu` includes a wide range of symbols which override the
`Emoji One Color` characters. The previous solution was to make
`Emoji One Color` the default system font, but that causes a number of issues
*(Check the issue queue.)* A better solution is a different font that doesn't
override any emoji characters such as `Bitstream Vera`. `Bitstream Vera` is
the source of the glyphs used in `DejaVu`, so it's not very different.

### Options
The `Noto` and `Roboto` font families conflict far less than `DejaVu`. You may
want to try them. Primary issues are the 0x2639 and 0x263a characters.

### Arch Linux
An AUR is available: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/emojione-color-font/

## Install on OS X
There are three install options for OS X. Both SVGinOT versions are available
from releases: https://github.com/eosrei/emojione-color-font/releases

1. `EmojiOneColor-SVGinOT-1.0-beta3.zip` - The regular version of the font
   installs like any other font and can be specifically selected, but OS X will
   default to the `Apple Color Emoji` font for emojis.
2. ` EmojiOneColor-SVGinOT-OSX-1.0-beta3.zip` - A hack to replace the `Apple
   Color Emoji` font by [using the same internal name][8]. Install and accept
   the warning in Font Book.
3. `emojione-apple.ttf` - A SBIX bitmap Apple-format Emoji One color font is
   [available in the emojione project][9].

*Reiterating: Only FireFox supports the SVGinOT color emoji for now. Safari and
Chrome will use the fallback black and white emoji.*

## Install on Windows

The font installs like any other font and can be specifically selected, but
the system will default to the `Segoe UI Emoji` font.

It can be manually selected in CSS, but making it the default is still TBD.

## Known issues

* [Symbols/emoji in monospace formatted text cause incorrect character
  alignment][10]. The whitespace character widths from the most recently selected
  fallback font are used in Pango/GTK applications.
* [The Firefox internal font cache is not cleared when the fontconfig
  changes][11]. Manually clear it in `about.config`, by setting
  `gfx.font_rendering.fontconfig.fontlist.enabled` to `false`, restarting, and
  setting it back to `true`. This may be encountered upgrading from v1.0-beta2
  to v1.0-beta3.

## Building
The build process has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux.

Overview:

1. B&W SVGs are generated on-the-fly from the color SVGs
2. The B&W SVGs are imported based on their filename to create either regular
   glyphs or ligature glyphs.
3. The color SVGs are imported to override both types of glyphs.

Required applications:

* Inkscape
* Imagemagick
* mkbitmap
* potrace
* FontTools
* FontForge
* SVGO
* [SCFBuild][12] *(created for this project!)*
* make

[12]: https://github.com/eosrei/scfbuild
Run: `make`

Or faster with multiple builds: `make -j 4`

*I am happy with the resulting outline glyphs, but there's room for improvement.
Let me know if you have ideas about making them look even better! I am not a
font building professional and only recently learned how to do all of this.* ðŸ˜‹
